<p>The combination of these 3 buildings .i.e. Melbourneâ€™s ancient prison, the significant Magistrate's Court and previous Police City Watch House was the heart of crime, law and order in Melbourne ever since the 1840's. The Old Melbourne Gaol is indeed of the hot tourist spot that allows an individual to discover a real 19th Century prison, and simulate being arrested and taken at a City Watch House, or take part in the provisional of Ned Kelly in the Old magistrates Court.</p>
