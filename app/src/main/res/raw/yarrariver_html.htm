<p>The Yarra River starts from the Yarra Ranges and streams towards the West for further than 240 km (148 miles) through country and outer Melbourne to the city centre and Docklands, where it discharges into Port Phillip Bay. In the present day Melbourne, the Yarra River passes through the Yarra Promenade and Flinders Street Station in the heart of Melbourne.</p>
