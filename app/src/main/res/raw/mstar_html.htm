<p>The Melbourne Star is another landmark in the Melbourne CBD and a massive wheel of about 120 m (394 ft.) tall having seven spokes, replicating the seven-pointed star of the Australian flag; located in the Waterfront City district in the Docklands area of Melbourne.The actual giant wheel itself was removed and substituted, but the original mainframe configuration and passenger cabins were reserved. It was perceived and planned to be completed in 2010 but it was not until 23 December 2013 that the Melbourne Star was functional again. </p>

<p>Melbourne Star is an experience like never before and it should be on the To-do list of any tourists or locals likewise. </p>

<p>Melbourne Star opened in December 2008 after a delay of 2 years, but then was shutdown 40 days later because of mechanical faults, and was consequently undone for most important fixes.However, the experience of Melbourne Star is just mind boggling and a ride (one complete rotation) takes 30 minutes that provides continuous 360-degree views of up to 40 kilometres incorporating the Docklands district, Melbourne’s CBD, Port Phillip Bay and as far as Mount Macedon, Arthur’s Seat and the Dandenong Range.</p>
