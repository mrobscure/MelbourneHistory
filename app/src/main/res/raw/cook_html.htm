<p>Cooks Cottage is also known as Captain Cooks Cottage that is a traditional landmark positioned in the attractive Fitzroy Gardens. Cooks Cottage was originally constructed in 1755 and not surprisingly is the ancient structure in Australia and a widely famous Melbourne sightseer fascination. </p>

<p>Cooks Cottage was formerly positioned in Yorkshire, England, and constructed by the parents of Captain James Cook. But the Cottage was transported to Melbourne by Sir Russell Grimwade in 1934. One of the astounding things about this cottage is that every brick was separately numbered, crammed into barrels and then distributed to Australia.</p>
